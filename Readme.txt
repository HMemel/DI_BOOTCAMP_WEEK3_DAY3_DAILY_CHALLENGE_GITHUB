********* Daily Challenge - Github ********

1 - Create a new github repository

2 - On your computer, create a new folder, and link it to your github repository

3 - In your local folder, create a file called planets.md with a list of the planets in the solar system. Markdown CheatSheet here and here

4 - Push this file to your repository

5 - Clone your repository to 2 separate locations.
I.e. Clone it to folder1 and clone it again to folder2. This will simulate 2 different developers working on the same project.

6 - Create 2 different branches, one in each of the local repos (folder1 and folder2).

7 - In each local repo (folder1 and folder2) update the code (differently) in the file planets.md.

8 - Push the file from one branch to github and merge to master. Then try to push the corresponding file from the other repo and merge it.

9 - Check out the conflict that you get, and fix it.
